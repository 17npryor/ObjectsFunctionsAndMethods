"""
This module lets you practice correcting SYNTAX (notation) errors.

Authors: David Mutchler, Dave Fisher, Valerie Galluzzi, Amanda Stouder,
         their colleagues and Nathan Pryor.
"""  # DONE: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.

########################################################################
# DONE: 2.
#   Locate the syntax (notation) errors in this file
#   by looking for red underlines.
#
#   For each error, try to make sense of its message.
#     -- Hover or expand as needed -- make sure you see the message!
#
#   Then fix the errors, one by one.
#     -- Fixing one error may bring up additional errors
#          (after a few seconds or when you run or save the module).
#     -- Each time, fix the ERROR that is currently nearest the TOP of the module.
#     -- Often the SOURCE of the error can be on the line just BEFORE
#          the line with a red underline.
#     -- New errors may appear when you RUN the module.
#
#    Finish by RUNNING the corrected program and making sure that it RUNS CORRECTLY.
#    That is, make sure that (per the doc-strings) the program
#    prints some calculated values and makes a Turtle do some things.
#
#  When complete Commit and Push your work (as always).
